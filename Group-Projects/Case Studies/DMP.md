This Data Management Plan is an Evergreen file that may be updated thought out the lifecycle of the project. Team Ignoto DCSR's data management plan (DMP) includes a brief description of the data, documentation, storage and backup, responsibility, and compliance.

Description: Team members selected projects to serve as case studies, to determine whether they met the Open Science Requirements and followed the FAIR Principles. Two datasets were selected for a deeper dive and analysis.

Documentation: The datasets have been downloaded, "CardioGoodFitness.csv" and "steps.csv." In addition, links to these datasets have been provided in the README.md file. The Jupyter Notebooks provided here show the code that was used in the analyses.

Storage & Backup: The datasets are publicly available. Individuals with access to the site and links are able to freely view the data, code, and associated documentation.

Summary of the publications expected from the proposed project and description of plans for making the publications publicly available: There are no plans of publishing the materials generated from this project.

Description of scientifically useful data expected to be produced by the proposed project and plans for making these data publicly available: The information provided here are for teaching and training purposes only. 

Roles and responsibilities of team members for the DMP tasks: Each team member will manage the information as appropriate and warranted. At the conclusion of the project, team members are not expected to maintain the contents on this page.

Best-effort compliance statements: To the best of our knowledge and ability, this DMP meets the current and applicable DMP requirements. This project will not require any variances from NASA or NLU policies.
