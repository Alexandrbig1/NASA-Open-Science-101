# Case Study: Ignoto DCSR Presentation Materials: 

**Descripton of Research**: 

> This project reviews different online projects found on the Internet (GitHub, Kaggle, and others) and ascertains whether the identified projects meet the NASA TOPS Principles of Open Science (Open Data, Open Code, Open Source, Open Results). This is to determine if developers have access to extract data or to compile code. The project also provides a brief overview of NASA FAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). 

---
**Terminology**: 

Open Science encompasses Open Data, Open Code, Open Source, and Open Results.

FAIR Principles encompass Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable data and information.

---
**Project Artifacts**:

The "CardioGoodFitness" dataset and "steps" are CSV files (.csv) of the raw data of the specific project and comparion project that the team used for a deeper dive.
The Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) contain the data analysis of the Cardio Good Fitness Case Study and Cardio Case Study. Jupyter Noteboooks contain Python and R code for visualizations. 

The Excel document (.xlsx) is the working file of the team's analysis of the selected projects.
The PowerPoint document (.pptx) is the summary and visual of the team's project.

The Questions file (.txt) is specific to the "CardioGoodFitness" dataset and "Cardio" dataset deep dive. 

The License document (.md) states that the products and outputs of the Case Studies Project are freely available to the public.

**Our Observations**: 

Not all information presented as Open Source is Open Code. Open Code is a spectrum, which may depend on policies, project objectives, among other reasons. A Software Management Plan (SMP) provides a framework, which may be adjusted during project execution.

Datasets are not formatted or standardized for immediate analysis.

["Cardio Dataset" Example](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shannonmcettrick/cardio).

["Biological sex and aerobic capacity are key determinants of peak fat oxidation rates during exercise" Example](https://researchdata.bath.ac.uk/611/)
Athough this dataset has a DOI (10.15125/BATH-00611) and an "Advanced" FAIR Level, the dataset needs to be standardized and formatted before analyses can be conducted, [FAIR Assessment](https://www.f-uji.net/index.php).

Open Data is the principle that may not always be provided due to policies in place to protect institutions and user information.
