## Introduction
Our project is based on the shift of music genres, depending on non-election and election years from 2016-2023.

## Project Process
- We put some ideas together, brainstormed, and narrow down questions.
- Created a hypothesis to narrow down.
- We researched different Kaggle data cards, going from three different sources to one.
- Faced some difficulties from finding data to believing that we were being biased in the process.
- We then decided to analyze these sources and create charts/tables to come to the conclusion of our hypothesis.
- We tried to predict the popularity of music such as the genre, danceability, loudness, etc., based on the election years.

## Results of Project 
We've come to the conclusion that the genres do not change whether they are non-election or election years but the danceability and loudness do.
Every year, the top songs on Spotify are Pop but the charts show that once it's non election years danceability, tempo, and loudness decrease.
