## Open Science Techniques Used
- Open data set: Kaggle data we have found
- Open data tools: Python
- Open License: CC-BY
## Project Team Members
- Emely Chuy
- David Fonseca
- Reva Kulkarni
- Phuong Thai-Garcia

## Project Process
- We put some ideas together, brainstormed, and narrow down questions.
- Created a hypothesis to narrow down.
- We researched different Kaggle data cards, going from three different sources to one.
- Faced some difficulties from finding data to believing that we were being biased in the process.
- We then decided to analyze these sources and create charts/tables to come to the conclusion of our hypothesis.
- We tried to predict the popularity of music such as the genre, danceability, loudness, etc., based on the election years.

## Results of Project 

- We've come to the conclusion that the genres do not change whether they are non-election or election years but the danceability.
- The elections years have a relationship with the danceability of pop music.
