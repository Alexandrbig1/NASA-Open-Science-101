## Project Title: Do user demographics play a role in the perception of emojis?

Emojis are used for various purposes in digital communication, including enhancing text, clarifying intent, saving time, cultural expressions, visual storytelling, and reactions. The serve to enhance and enrich digital communication by adding a visual and emotional layer to text. This study is researching if emojis are perceived differently based on age, gender, or ethnicity or if there is a generally agreed upon understanding of individual emoji meaning.
