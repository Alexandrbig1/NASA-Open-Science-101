Project Title: Yearly Global Climate Temperature Changes in 10 Hottest and 10 Coldest Places

Project Team

Globally we have seen temperature increases in most parts of the world, Alaska, northern and western hemispheres. While some parts of the world are heating up annually on a modular scale this data research provides data findings, and graphical results of global temperature changes over the past 20 years in the hottest and coldest parts of the world.

Hypothesis- Examining weather datasets and identifying the 10 hottest and coldest places globally and to answer the question, are these global places getting hotter, colder and to what temperature differences over the past 20 years?
Additional questions were answered during the studying of various data sets during the research period:

1.  Which countries have seen the highest and lowest changes in temperature between 2000-2023? 
2.  What might be contributing to these extremes?
3.  Are the 10 hottest places getting hotter and if so, how often?
4.  Are the 10 Coldest places getting colder or warmer and if so, how often and what temperature changes over the course of 20 years? 
5.  How has the temperature changed, is there a pattern and how much deviation is it?
6.  Is there a correlation in income level affected by global temperature change?
7.  Based on the given dataset history, can we predict what the temperature in these places would be next year?
8.  If the country is surrounded by a body of water, is humidity affecting the countries based on inland vs areas close to the coastline?
