# Team AstroPioneers: Analysis of Asteroid Data Observations:

**Descripton of Research**:

> This project reviews different online projects found on the Internet (GitHub, Kaggle, and others) and ascertains whether the identified projects meet the NASA TOPS Principles of Open Science (Open Data, Open Code, Open Source, Open Results). This is to determine if developers have access to data and code, allowing them to extract data or to compile code. The project also provides a brief overview of NASA FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) Principles.

---

**Terminology**:

Open Science encompasses Open Data, Open Code, Open Source, and Open Results.

FAIR Principles encompass Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable data and information.

**Initial Observations and Progress**:

As of the first day of our workshop at NASA, we have started gathering resources and defining the scope of our research. Our focus is on NASA's Nearest Earth Objects (1910-2024). Over the next week, we will be examining various datasets and code repositories to evaluate their compliance with Open Science and FAIR Principles. Further updates and detailed observations will be added as the project progresses.
