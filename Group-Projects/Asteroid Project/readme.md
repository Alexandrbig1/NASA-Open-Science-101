# Team AstroPioneers: Asteroid Impact Risk Assessment Project (AIRAP)

**Descripton of Research**:

> The Asteroid Impact Risk Assessment Project (AIRAP) aims to evaluate and analyze data on near-Earth asteroids to assess their potential collision risk with our planet. The project focuses on asteroids with diameters ranging from 140 meters to 1 kilometer, as these sizes are significant enough to potentially cause substantial damage if they impact Earth. The team will attempt to analyze asteroid proximity measuring distances as close as 0.05 astronomical units (AU) from Earth—one AU being the average distance between Earth and the Sun, roughly 93 million miles.

> Velocity measurements are critical, with many near-Earth asteroids traveling at speeds exceeding 15 kilometers per second. This rapid movement heightens the urgency of accurate predictions and assessments. The core objective of this analysis is to determine the probability of a collision, calculated through sophisticated modeling that incorporates orbital data and gravitational perturbations. By analyzing these factors, the project provides essential risk assessments, highlighting asteroids with a significant impact probability over the coming centuries. AIRAP’s findings are crucial for developing potential mitigation strategies and enhancing global preparedness for possible asteroid threats. The project utilizes NASA's Open Science principles of Open Data, Open Tools, Open Code, and Open Results.

**Initial Observations and Progress:**

### Day 1: Initial Observations and Progress

As of the first day of our workshop at NASA, we have started gathering resources and defining the scope of our research. Our focus is on NASA's Nearest Earth Objects (1910-2024). Over the next week, we will be examining various datasets and code repositories to evaluate their compliance with Open Science and FAIR Principles. Further updates and detailed observations will be added as the project progresses.

### Day 2: Preparing Questions and Hypotheses

On the second day of our workshop, we focused on preparing the right questions to guide our research. These questions will help us delve deeper into the data and extract meaningful insights. Here are the questions we developed:

- On average, how many asteroids are hazardous to Earth?
- What is the average miss distance of asteroids?
- What is the size distribution of asteroids?
- How far/close are asteroids from Earth?
- How many asteroids are considered harmful?
- What is the ratio between harmful and non-harmful asteroids?
- What are the statistical measures for each attribute/field/column?
- Do bigger (size) asteroids move faster than smaller ones?

We also formulated a hypothesis to test:

- **Hypothesis**: Asteroids with smaller diameters have greater velocity.

To support our research, we created functions to calculate key metrics:

- A function to find the average diameter of asteroids.
- A function to find the average velocity of asteroids.

These foundational steps will guide us as we dive deeper into the analysis of NASA's asteroid data in the coming days.

### Day 3: Validating Our Hypothesis

On Day 3 of our NASA workshop, we focused on testing our hypothesis: **Do smaller asteroids move faster than larger ones?** With the right questions in mind, we utilized Python and Pandas to build functions that allowed us to analyze our asteroid data in detail.

**Key Steps**:

- **Data Analysis:** We developed Python functions to extract and analyze key metrics.
- **Visualization:** We created a diagram to visualize the relationship between asteroid size and velocity.
- **Findings:** The analysis confirmed our hypothesis—smaller asteroids tend to move faster than larger ones.

Dr. Antonio's guidance was instrumental in refining our approach and ensuring the accuracy of our findings.

### Day 4:

**Project Artifacts:**

- `AsteroidData.ipynb` - Initial data exploration, focusing on data cleaning and basic analysis.
- `AsteroidData2.ipynb` - In-depth analysis with visualizations of asteroid size and velocity.
- `AsteroidData.csv` - Dataset used in the project, containing relevant asteroid information from NASA.

**Research Questions:**

1. On average, how many asteroids are hazardous to Earth?
2. What is the average miss distance of asteroids?
3. What is the size distribution of asteroids?
4. How far/close are asteroids from Earth?
5. How many asteroids are considered harmful?
6. What is the ratio between harmful and non-harmful asteroids?
7. What are the statistical measures for each attribute/field/column?
8. Do bigger (size) asteroids move faster than smaller ones?

**Hypothesis:**

> Asteroids with smaller diameters have greater velocity.

### Our Observations:

- **Smaller Asteroids' Velocity**: Our analysis confirmed that smaller asteroids tend to have greater velocity than larger ones, aligning with our hypothesis.
- **Hazardous Asteroids**:
- **Miss Distance Patterns**:

Each observation was derived from the analysis conducted through Python and Pandas, with significant guidance from Dr. Antonio.
