# Team AstroPioneers: Asteroid Impact Risk Assessment Project (AIRAP)

**Descripton of Research**:

> The Asteroid Impact Risk Assessment Project (AIRAP) aims to evaluate and analyze data on near-Earth asteroids to assess their potential collision risk with our planet. The project focuses on asteroids with diameters ranging from 140 meters to 1 kilometer, as these sizes are significant enough to potentially cause substantial damage if they impact Earth. The team will attempt to analyze asteroid proximity measuring distances as close as 0.05 astronomical units (AU) from Earth—one AU being the average distance between Earth and the Sun, roughly 93 million miles.

> Velocity measurements are critical, with many near-Earth asteroids traveling at speeds exceeding 15 kilometers per second. This rapid movement heightens the urgency of accurate predictions and assessments. The core objective of this analysis is to determine the probability of a collision, calculated through sophisticated modeling that incorporates orbital data and gravitational perturbations. By analyzing these factors, the project provides essential risk assessments, highlighting asteroids with a significant impact probability over the coming centuries. AIRAP’s findings are crucial for developing potential mitigation strategies and enhancing global preparedness for possible asteroid threats. The project utilizes NASA's Open Science principles of Open Data, Open Tools, Open Code, and Open Results.

**Initial Observations and Progress**:

As of the first day of our workshop at NASA, we have started gathering resources and defining the scope of our research. Our focus is on NASA's Nearest Earth Objects (1910-2024). Over the next week, we will be examining various datasets and code repositories to evaluate their compliance with Open Science and FAIR Principles. Further updates and detailed observations will be added as the project progresses.
