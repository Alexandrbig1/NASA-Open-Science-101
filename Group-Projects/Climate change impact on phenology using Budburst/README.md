# Day 1 Recap
Introduction to Budburst

Downloaded BB data set and chose red maple as our organism

Formulate questions:
  1. How does temperature change affect red maple phenophase in 2023 compared to 2008?
  2. Does temperature affect the number of red maple observations in a state or region?
  3. Is the loss of the American Redstart habitat due to warming summer temperatures?


# Day 2 Recap
We generated hypotheses from the three questions from Day 1. (See hypotheses word document attachment)

We narrowed our Budburst data set for red maple observations taken in 2013 and 2023, specifically for the first bud phenophase.

We selected seven states for which observations of the first bud phenophase were made in the years 2013 and 2023. 

We used a historical weather data set to look up average monthly temperatures for the years 2013 and 2023 for the months that the observations were made. 


# Day 3 Recap
Continued working on project.

We refined details of oberservations from the data set that we have found on Budburst.

Group has produced code to filter out selected observations selected on day 2.


# Day 4 Recap
Entire workshop went on a field trip to Chicago Botanic Garden to enjoy and make observations on the Budburst app.


# Day 5 Recap
Final Day of workshop and to finish up projects.

We refined and added final details and information to complete the week long project.

Groups have presented projects to the entire workshop of their information that they have found.

This has concluded the NASA TOPS Open Science workshop!
